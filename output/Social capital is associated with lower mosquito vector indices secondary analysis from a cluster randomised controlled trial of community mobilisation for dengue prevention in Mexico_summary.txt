Based on the provided data, I'll create a clean structured summary. Since there are multiple entries with the same author(s) and year, I'll merge duplicates and resolve conflicts logically.

### Summary
* **Author(s)**: Alvarado-Castro et al.
* **Year**: 2019
* **Study design**: Secondary analysis of a cluster randomized controlled trial (Camino Verde trial)
* **Sample size**: 10,112 households (from 45 intervention clusters and 45 control clusters or 5181 in intervention clusters and 4931 in control clusters)
* **Baseline data**: 
	+ Distribution of household social capital scores: bimodal distribution
	+ Social capital index: 4 constructs (involvement, participation, investment, and communication)
	+ Households in rural areas had higher social capital scores than households in urban areas (58% vs 23%, OR 4.51, 95% CI 3.26-6.26)
* **After intervention data**:
	+ Social capital index: minimum value of 0.77 and a maximum value of 0.84, with 4 constructs (involvement, participation, communication, and investment)
	+ Vector indices: 
		- Household positivity for larvae or pupae
		- Household positivity for pupae
		- Pupae per household index (PHI)
		- Pupae per person index (PPI)
	+ Households with high social capital: more likely to be negative for larvae or pupae (OR 1.38, 95% CI 1.12-1.69) and for pupae specifically (OR 1.37, 95% CI 1.08-1.74)
	+ Interaction between intervention status and social capital: a combined variable of intervention/high social capital remained associated with larvae or pupae (ORa 1.56, 95% CI 1.19-2.04) and with pupae specifically (ORa 1.65, 95% CI 1.20-2.28)
	+ Households in intervention clusters had higher social capital scores than those in control clusters, but the difference was not significant at the 5% level (OR 1.31, 95% CI 0.87-1.98)
	+ Mean pupal indices were lower among households with high social capital scores, significant only in rural areas

The entries with "Not stated" or "Not explicitly stated" for certain fields were not included in the summary as they did not provide any additional information.

The different study designs mentioned in the entries were merged into a single study design, "Secondary analysis of a cluster randomized controlled trial (Camino Verde trial)", which is the most specific and detailed description provided.

The sample size was taken from the entries that provided a specific number (10,112 households).

The baseline data and after intervention data were merged from the different entries, ensuring that the information is consistent and not duplicated.
